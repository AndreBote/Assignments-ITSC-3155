Requirements:

An automatic ham sandwich maker uses a set of programmed ingredients to make sandwiches. First, users
select the size of the sandwich, then the machine determines how much resources are available before
making it. The user receives a message if there are insufficient resources. Otherwise, the user must pay
for sandwich by coins. The machine will indicate if insufficient coins are inserted or if there is an exchange
